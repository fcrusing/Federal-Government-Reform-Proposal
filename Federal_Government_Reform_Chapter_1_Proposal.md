title: "Federal Government Reform: Chapter 1 - Comprehensive Proposal"
---

# 1. Mission Statement

This proposal aims to establish a framework that promotes efficient,
streamlined government operations. By implementing a disciplined
planning and budgeting approach and leveraging advanced AI tools, we
will ensure optimal allocation of taxpayer dollars, provide improved
public service, and support a leaner, more agile federal government.

Our overarching mission is to swiftly evaluate the structure and
functions of Executive Branch departments and agencies, determining
which should be retained, which should be disbanded, and how essential
functions from disbanded organizations should be strategically
reassigned to remaining entities. This initiative prioritizes
efficiency, accountability, and a well-defined reallocation of essential
services to sustain government functions aligned with public needs.

## 1.1 Running a Leaner, More Efficient Government

Through a comprehensive evaluation of all federal agencies, we will
identify which agencies should remain essential public service providers
and which are redundant, inefficient, or misaligned with constitutional
mandates. Leveraging AI-powered Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB), this
assessment will help disband or consolidate redundant entities.
Essential records from disbanded agencies will be securely retained,
cataloged, and made accessible through an AI-enabled, centralized system
that allows for easy retr...

## 1.2 Establishing a Future-Ready Planning and Budgeting Framework with Enhanced Enterprise Performance Management (EPM)

For the agencies that remain, this initiative will implement a
cutting-edge Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) system to support
the ZBB process. By integrating advanced AI capabilities, this system
will enhance resource allocation, real-time performance tracking, and
data-driven decision-making. EPM will provide key additional
capabilities to ensure alignment with ZBB, including:  
- Comprehensive Data Aggregation and Analysis: EPM tools will
consolidate data across all government agencies, creating a centralized
view of operations, budgets, and outcomes.  
- Real-Time Performance Tracking and Adjustment: EPM provides real-time
monitoring, allowing immediate corrective action to ensure efficient use
of funds.  
- Automated Reporting and KPI Alignment: EPM facilitates automated
reporting with KPIs tailored to each agency's mission, reinforcing
data-driven accountability.  
- Scenario Planning and Predictive Analytics: EPM includes predictive
analytics, enabling scenario planning for informed budgetary
decisions.  
- Enhanced Accountability and Transparency: Each department’s
performance, budget adherence, and outcomes will be visible to senior
leaders, Congress, and the public.

## 1.3 Supporting Transition for Government Personnel

Recognizing the potential impact on federal employees, we will offer
comprehensive support to mitigate disruption while prioritizing
merit-based reassignment in the reformed structure:  
- Severance Packages and Career Transition Assistance: For those whose
positions are eliminated, we will provide competitive severance packages
and connect displaced employees with private-sector opportunities.  
- Business Transition Support and Merit-Based Reassignment: Employees
whose roles are eliminated must bolster their resumes to qualify for new
roles. If functions are reassigned, employees will be considered for
positions within the new structure based solely on merit.

## 1.4 Stakeholder Engagement and Transparent Public Communication

Building and maintaining public trust is a core principle of this
reform. Our transparency initiative includes:  
- Public Access to Government Records: Establish an online Public
Records Portal where citizens, stakeholders, and media can access
searchable databases of all non-classified, unclassified records,
minimizing FOIA requests.  
- Real-Time Public Accountability Dashboard: A public-facing dashboard
will provide visibility into agency performance, budget adherence, and
spending efficiency.  
- Engagement with Congressional Leaders and Key Stakeholders: Maintain
ongoing dialogue with Congress to build bipartisan support for the
reform.  
- Open Government and Citizen Feedback Channels: Accessible channels
will allow citizens to submit questions and suggestions to agencies.  
- Proactive Media Briefings and Public Statements: Regular briefings and
updates will inform the public about key decisions and reform
milestones.  
- Data-Driven Reporting and Publication of Findings: Publish data-driven
reports on ZBB outcomes, cost savings, and performance improvements.

## 1.5 Enhanced Subcontracting and Contractor Accountability

In transitioning certain government functions to the private sector,
this reform will adopt a fully merit-based and competitive contracting
model. All contract awards will prioritize demonstrated capability,
expertise, and value. Where legally permissible, this approach will
eliminate the need for special designations, ensuring merit-based
selection.  
The subcontracting framework will include:  
- Merit-Based Awards: Contracts are awarded based on competitive
evaluation, prioritizing qualifications and expertise.  
- Incentives for Outstanding Performance: High-performing contractors
may earn contract extensions, priority for future projects, or financial
rewards.  
- Penalties for Underperformance: Underperforming contractors may face
reduced payments, termination, or disqualification from future
projects.  
- Responsiveness and Agile Decision-Making: Contractors must respond
within five business days, with Best and Final Offers (BAFOs) due within
ten business days, enabling rapid contractor selection.

## 1.6 Ensuring Long-Term Fiscal Discipline and Risk Management

To maintain the reform’s fiscal goals, we will implement a risk
management framework to address potential challenges, including service
continuity and cybersecurity risks. This will include:  
- Regular Audits and Compliance Checks: Ensures adherence to reform
principles and prevents inefficiencies.  
- Future-Proof Financial Discipline: Instilling discipline through
data-driven budgeting, spending reviews, and continuous performance
checks across departments.

## 1.7 Public Accountability and Oversight Mechanisms

To uphold a results-oriented and transparent government, a public
accountability dashboard will be created. This dashboard will allow
citizens to track progress and view government agency metrics, fostering
public engagement and enabling real-time oversight. By offering
visibility into spending efficiency, program effectiveness, and project
milestones, we strengthen public trust and demonstrate our commitment to
a responsive, accountable government.
