# Federal Government Reform Proposal

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive **Federal Government Reform Proposal**, outlining a strategy for a leaner, more efficient, and transparent U.S. federal government. The proposal is organized into chapters, each addressing specific aspects of the reform process, including budgeting, transparency, contractor accountability, and employee transitions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this reform is to streamline federal operations by identifying which agencies should remain, which should be disbanded, and how essential functions from disbanded agencies should be reallocated. This proposal emphasizes accountability, fiscal responsibility, and clear alignment with constitutional mandates.

### [Chapter 3: AI-Powered ZBB and EPM for Public Sector](https://github.com/fcrusing/Federal-Government-Reform-Proposal/blob/main/Federal_Government_Reform_Chapter_3_AI_Powered_ZBB_EPM_for_Public_Sector.md)

**Federal Government Reform Plan - Chapter 3: AI-Powered ZBB and EPM for Public Sector** introduces the integration of an AI-powered platform within the Executive Branch to streamline Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) and Enterprise Performance Management (EPM). This chapter outlines how AI enhances the budgeting process by enabling cross-agency comparisons, optimizing resource allocation, and supporting accountability through performance tracking with tailored Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

#### Key Highlights:
- **Cross-Agency Document Capture**: The AI platform aggregates documents and data from all Executive Branch agencies, providing a comprehensive dataset for budget analysis and strategic decision-making.
- **Identifying Overlapping Functions**: AI algorithms detect redundancies and overlapping functions across agencies, empowering managers to avoid duplications and streamline service delivery.
- **AI-Assisted Budget Creation**: Managers can utilize AI to justify expenses from scratch, establish budgets aligned with agency priorities, and forecast resource needs based on historical data and trends.
- **KPI Tracking for EPM**: The platform simplifies KPI assignment, monitors progress, and provides real-time reporting for performance evaluation, benchmarking against similar programs across agencies.
- **Decision Support for Consolidation**: AI-driven recommendations identify potential consolidations across agencies, highlighting opportunities for cost savings and improved service effectiveness.

By integrating AI with ZBB and EPM, Chapter 3 emphasizes a more transparent, efficient, and data-driven approach to budgeting in the public sector, aligning resources with strategic goals while reinforcing accountability and public trust.
